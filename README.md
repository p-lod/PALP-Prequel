# PALP Prequel

PALP Prequel is a Flask web application that was created to help researchers prepare images for the PALP project. It uses data from [Pitture e pavimenti di Pompei](https://www.worldcat.org/title/pitture-e-pavimenti-di-pompei/oclc/490575255),  [PompeiiinPictures](https://pompeiiinpictures.com/pompeiiinpictures/index.htm), and [an ArcGIS Map](https://arcg.is/ivHP0). The prequel is currently hosted at [https://prequel.p-lod.umasscreate.net/](https://prequel.p-lod.umasscreate.net/).

## User Workflow

Users start by entering an location, which queries the various databases. They then can describe the images they see, such as if there's art on a specific wall and what ARC number might be relevant to it.
